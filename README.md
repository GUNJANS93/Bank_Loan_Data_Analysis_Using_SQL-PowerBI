# Bank Loan Data Analysis Using SQL & PowerBI
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using SQL and Power BI to derive actionable insights into loan performance metrics, borrower profiles, and market trends.

Project Objectives:
1. Analyze the bank's loan portfolio to understand the distribution of loans across different categories (e.g., mortgage, personal loans, business loans).
2. Evaluate the performance of loans based on various metrics such as default rates, repayment patterns, and profitability.
3. Identify trends and patterns within the loan portfolio to support strategic planning and forecasting.
4. Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI for dynamic visualization of key metrics and trends.
5. Generate actionable insights to optimize lending practices, manage risks, and improve portfolio performance.

Tools and Software used:
1. MS Office Excel
2. MS SQL Server 20.2
3. MS PowerBI 2.132

SQL Operations:
1. Data Extraction: Extracted relevant data from bank's databases using SQL queries such as SUM, COUNT, AVG which retreived information on loan types, repayment histories and borrower demographics.
2. Data Transformation:  Cleanse and transform the extracted data to ensure consistency and accuracy, involving handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and aggregating data for analysis.
3. Data Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and uncover insights into loan portfolio dynamics, risk profiles, and profitability.
4. Visualization: Develop interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI to present findings effectively. Dashboards may include charts, graphs, and tables to convey trends, patterns, and comparisons within the loan portfolio.
5. Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the analysis results to derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making processes related to loan management, risk mitigation, and portfolio optimization.


A comprehensive overview of our lending operations and to monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.â€™ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.


This structured approach ensures the effective utilization of data analytics to drive strategic initiatives and operational excellence within the banking sector.
